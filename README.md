Code challenge submission, in response to `https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Kaldari/Task_2`.

Limitations
===========
* No i18n support, English is hardcoded everywhere.
* No subcategory handling.
* No result pager.
* Crappy aesthetics.
* Probably more readable if it used promises, I'm still puzzling over lambda programming.
* Doesn't resolve article redirects.
